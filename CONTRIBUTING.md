## Pull Requests

> [!NOTE]
> Before creating an Pull Request, check whether there is a similar PR in the works or not, or 
> if there are any issues discussing what you trying to achieve

Pull requests are a great way to get your ideas into a Dotanuki Labs project.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your contribution. Hence, consider 
discussing your problem (and eventually details on your solution) in a issue first.

### Is it of the expected quality

- There are no spelling mistakes and it reads well
- It builds ( all CI workflows/jobs are green)
- It is well sized and brings additional comments over code when they are needed
- It solves one problem and solves it well

You can refer to the `README` and `CONTRIBUTING` documents in a project to learn how to get started 
with local development, and also to learn about specific guidelines per project.

Thank you so much for your PRs ðŸ”¥
