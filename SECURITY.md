# Security Policies

## Best practices

Dotanuki actively cares about Open Source Security and Quality.

- Almost all of our projects keep dependencies up-to-date with [Renovate Bot](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate), merging PRs automatically with [Mergify](https://mergify.com/)
- We track dependency graphs and/or SBOM files as part of CI executions
- We release manually and careful review what's being shipped every release
- We invest into [Open Source Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev/)
- We invest into [Security Scorecards](https://securityscorecards.dev/)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

> [!WARN]
>
> **DO NOT raise GitHub issues to report a security vulnerabilities.**

Please report potential security issues affecting any of our projects to **[ubiratan.soares@protonmail.com](mailto:ubiratan.soares@protonmail.com)**,
preferably with a proof of concept.

You will receive a response from us within 24 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon as possible.

Non-vulnerability-related security issues such as new ideas for security features are welcome on GitHub Issues.
